## Development Tips

### Backend Development

- Use `uvicorn main:app --reload` for auto-reload during development
- Check API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
- Use the demo.py as reference for agent behavior

### Frontend Development

- Use `npm run dev` for hot-reload
- Components are in `src/components/`
- Tailwind classes are available for styling

### Adding New Agents

To add a new agent to the pipeline:

1. Update `backend/agents.py`:
   - Add agent creation in `initialize_agents()`
   - Update pipeline in `run_chef_show()`

2. Update `frontend/src/components/ChefShowDisplay.tsx`:
   - Add agent icon in `getAgentIcon()`
   - Add agent color in `getAgentColor()`

## Questions?

Feel free to:
- Open an issue for questions
- Check existing documentation
- Review demo.py for examples
